In this bitbucket page, we share our code and data sets for the following paper: 

@inproceedings{ZhengC16,

} 

Please cite the above reference for using our code / data sets.

**************************************************************************

In the directory of "./Data/", we list the data sets in three applications: 
1. Entity Information Extraction (EIE);
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER);
3. Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS).

For EIE, we have three data sets, corresponding to EIE in three domains:
1.a. Researcher; 
1.b. Car;
1.c. Product.
The description about data collection is given in the "EIE_Datasets.pdf".

For NER, we have two data sets, corresponding to NER in two domains:
2.a. Citation;
a.b. Seminar.

For POS, we have four data sets, corresponding to POS in four languages: 
3.a. Danish;
3.b. Dutch; 
3.c. Portuguese;
3.d. Swedish.


In the directory of "./Code/", we list the codes in EIE, NER and POS, respectively.
